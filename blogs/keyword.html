            <h3>Key words in cryptocurrency</h3>
            <p>There are many words and terms in cryptocurrency that sound foreign to those new to this space. </p>
            <p>This is a quick, simple guide to the key terms commonly used. As new terms are introduced and popularized, they will be added here.</p>
            <p>In alphabetical order:</p>
            <p><strong>Altcoin</strong> - a cryptocurrency, which uses the original source code of Bitcoin but has been developed/programmed to become an independent coin/token with characteristics and functions different from Bitcoin. </p>
            <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> - the first and original peer-to-peer global digital currency that doesn't require the trust of a middleman such as a central bank to facilitate financial transactions. Instead, such transactions are publicly facilitated through the use of blockchain technology. </p>
            <p><strong>Blockchain</strong> - a shared public network, which records and displays a continuing chain of economic transactions. Unlike traditional networks, it simultaneously runs on multiple computers called nodes. Hence, where a node breaks or shuts down, the presence of other nodes keeps the network running.  </p>
            <p><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> - a digital asset designed to work as a peer-to-peer medium of exchange whilst utilizing strong cryptography to secure financial transactions.  </p>
            <p><strong>Dapps</strong> - an abbreviation of “decentralized applications”.</p>
            <p><strong>Exchange Coin</strong> – A digital currency offered by its parent crypto exchange for the primary purposes of purchasing other altcoins and IEOs through the exchange’s trading platform.</p>
            <p><strong>Hodl</strong> - Intentionally misspelled. The alphabets “l” and “d” were re-arranged from the original word “Hold”. It describes a person who invests in cryptocurrency and holds onto his digital assets long-term in hopes of a high-return, regardless of their current values. </p>
            <p><strong>Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</strong> – works similarly like an IPO, wherein a start-up makes an initial offering to retail investors to buy and own its digital assets in order to raise funds for its cryptocurrency projects. </p>
            <p><strong>Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)</strong> – a tokenized asset, which shares many similarities to an ICO. The key difference lies in the medium where tokens are offered. Instead of a startup that does it, it is the appointed crypto exchange that administers the initial offering.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining</strong> - the process of nodes verifying transactions by solving a complicated mathematical problem called hash and are rewarded coins/tokens supporting the blockchain</p>
            <p><strong>Node</strong> - a supercomputer, which runs an application or software while participates in an interconnected network such as blockchain. </p>
            <p><strong>Private Coin</strong> – A digital currency, which integrates the advantages of blockchain technology with a heavy emphasis on privacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Proof-of-Work</strong> - the process of a person earning coins/tokens via mining.</p>
            <p><strong>Proof-of-Stack</strong> - the process of a person earning coins/tokens via holding the same assets.</p>
            <p><strong>Security Coin Offering (SCO)</strong> - a regulated digital security that is backed by a physical asset that exists in the real-world such as real estates.</p>
            <p><strong>Shitcoin</strong> - term used to describe an altcoin, which has no utility use nor value.</p>
            <p><strong>Stablecoin</strong> - A digital currency, which integrates the advantages of blockchain technology while still retaining a stable value that does not fluctuate. Its stability is usually retained by pegging it on a fixed ratio to a single or a combination of more established assets such as fiat currency (i.e USD, AUS) or gold.

            <p><strong>Statechain</strong> - A layer 2 protocol that allows participants (involving the user, the recipient and the statechain provider) to complete an off-chain multi-signature transaction. To learn more about statechain, click here.</p>
            <p><strong>Utility Token</strong> - A type of digital asset programmed for specific utility purposes. It rarely has its own blockchain to run on. Rather, it will be built on an established blockchain platform. </p>
