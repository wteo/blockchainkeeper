# Blockchain Keeper

An static blog I designed discussing blockchain and/or cryptocurrency.

# About 

At present, the blog has no content. Hence, there is no existing link to any of the blog posts you see on the main page. Its purpose was simply for me to get comfortable with the basics of HTML and CSS. This is the first time I build and design a website from scratch.

You can still browse by clicking on the buttons you see at the top and bottom horizontal navigation bars respectively.
